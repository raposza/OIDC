/**
 * What a caller wants minted.
 *
 * <h2>The component names are the JSON field names</h2>
 *
 * So they are `alg`, `sub`, `aud` and not `strAlgorithm`, `strSubject`,
 * `lstAudience`. This record is a wire contract rather than a domain type: the
 * names are the ones a JWT carries and the ones every example on the internet
 * uses, and a caller composing a curl line should not have to learn a second
 * spelling of `aud`.
 *
 * EVERY COMPONENT IS OPTIONAL. A null means "the service decides"; it does not
 * mean "omit the claim". To omit a claim the service would otherwise write,
 * send it as null inside {@link #claims}, which is applied last and removes as
 * well as sets.
 *
 * <h2>The examples are the ones that work against this window's sandbox</h2>
 *
 * `participant_admin` is the user Canton creates for itself, `sandbox` is the
 * participant node name this application starts, and the two derived values -
 * the audience and the scope - follow Canton's own conventions. So the
 * body Swagger fills in mints a token the running participant accepts, rather
 * than one that has to be edited first.
 *
 * @param alg one of {@link com.raposza.jwt.MintAlg}, including NONE
 * @param kid a specific key, overriding the one `alg` would pick
 * @param sub the `sub` claim
 * @param iss the `iss` claim; blank omits it, null takes the service's
 * @param aud the `aud` claim, one value or several
 * @param scope the `scope` claim
 * @param ttlSeconds lifetime; 0 or less omits `exp` entirely
 * @param shape AUDIENCE, SCOPE or CUSTOM to fill the Canton defaults for that
 *        shape, or null to write only what is asked for
 * @param actAs CUSTOM only
 * @param readAs CUSTOM only
 * @param admin CUSTOM only
 * @param applicationId CUSTOM only
 * @param ledgerId CUSTOM only
 * @param participantId CUSTOM only, and the audience AUDIENCE derives when no
 *        `aud` is given
 * @param claims merged LAST over everything above, so it can override or remove
 *        any claim the service writes
 *
