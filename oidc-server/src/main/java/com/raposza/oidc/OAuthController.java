/**
 * The OAuth and OpenID Connect token surface: the discovery document and the
 * token endpoint.
 *
 * <h2>Raposza OIDC is NOT a replacement for Keycloak, and never will be</h2>
 *
 * It stands in for a production identity provider on a test system. It speaks
 * the same protocol - OpenID Connect Discovery and Core, RFC 7636 PKCE,
 * RP-Initiated Logout - so that a relying party configured against it moves to
 * Keycloak by changing settings and nothing else. `oidc_check.py` at the root
 * of this repository is the contract both are held to.
 *
 * <h2>Two grants for people, one for machines</h2>
 *
 * `authorization_code` is what a browser application uses: the person signs in
 * at {@link OidcController}'s login page and the application exchanges the code
 * here, with its PKCE verifier. `refresh_token` renews what that produced. Both
 * are checked as OpenID Connect Core and RFC 7636 require - {@link OidcFlow}.
 *
 * `client_credentials` is the machine grant, and it stays deliberately
 * unchecked: any client id, any secret, and the request decides what the token
 * carries. That is the difference from the local test identity provider in
 * raposza-test-idp, which registers clients in its constructor and IGNORES the
 * scope a request asks for, precisely so it cannot be talked into minting
 * something it was not configured for. That is the right shape for a fixture
 * inside a test. It is the wrong shape here: a developer can ask this service
 * for any token at all without editing and restarting anything, including
 * tokens that should be refused. `client_id` becomes the subject when nothing
 * else says otherwise, and the secret is not checked.
 *
 * <h2>What the discovery document is</h2>
 *
 * An OpenID Provider configuration, OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 section 3,
 * served unchanged at the RFC 8414 location as well. It advertises what is
 * built and nothing else: the authorization, token, UserInfo, JWKS and
 * end-session endpoints, the code response type, S256 PKCE, and RS256 ID
 * tokens. A member with nothing to say is left out, because Discovery section
 * 4.2 forbids an empty array.
 *
 * <h2>Every token path is served under three names</h2>
 *
 * `/oauth2/token` is the project convention and the one the discovery document
 * advertises. `/oauth/token` and `/token` are kept because configurations
 * written before the convention point at them. A conforming client reads
 * `token_endpoint` and is unaffected by any of this.
 *
