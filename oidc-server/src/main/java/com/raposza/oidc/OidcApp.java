/**
 * Raposza OIDC - the identity provider.
 *
 * <h2>What it is for</h2>
 *
 * Testing authorization, not being secure. It holds a permanent key per
 * algorithm, publishes both halves of the set - the private one too, on
 * request - and mints a token from whatever a caller asks for, including
 * tokens that are deliberately wrong. Every one of those is a property a
 * production identity provider must not have.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is one service and outside the profiles</h2>
 *
 * A participant is configured against a JWKS url at start. If the key material
 * belonged to a profile, selecting a different Canton would move the url and
 * every token already issued would stop verifying against the node that was
 * still running. One mint, one key set, one address: a token minted for the
 * 2.9 stack is the same token the 3.5 stack accepts, and the only thing that
 * differs between them is the `auth-services` block each was given.
 *
 * <h2>The package is `com.raposza.oidc`</h2>
 *
 * The product name, not the name of the one feature it started as. The JOSE
 * half in `oidc-core` keeps `com.raposza.jwt` because `raposza-auth` imports
 * it and a rename there would fork the client code as well - `raposza_oidc.md`
 * section 4. The SETTINGS prefix stays `raposza.jwtmint` for the same kind of
 * reason, stated in `README.md`: it is the compatibility surface with every
 * launcher and configuration file that already names it.
 *
 * <h2>Endpoints</h2>
 *
 * The `/oauth2/` names are a PROJECT CONVENTION and no part of any protocol.
 * The older spellings are kept because configurations written before it point
 * at them; a conforming client reads both from the discovery document and is
 * untouched by either.

 * GET  /                                what this serves, in plain text
 * GET  /ui/                             the web UI - six pages
 * GET  /oauth2/jwks                     the PUBLIC set - a participant's `url`
 * GET  /jwks.json                       the same, and /.well-known/jwks.json
 * GET  /oauth2/jwks-private             the FULL set; behind the admin credential
 * GET  /jwks-private.json               the same

 * GET  /.well-known/openid-configuration   the OpenID Provider configuration
 * GET  /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server   the same document, RFC 8414
 * GET  /oauth2/authorize                sign in - the login page, then a code
 * POST /oauth2/token                    authorization_code, refresh_token,

 * GET  /admin/status                    where the keys are and when they loaded
 * POST /admin/reload                    re-read the JWKS from disk
 * GET  /admin/reload                    the same, so a browser can do it
 * *    /api/ui/*                        what the UI calls; behind the credential
 * GET  /swagger-ui.html                 the whole of the above, interactive
 * GET  /v3/api-docs                     the OpenAPI document behind it
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>One issuer</h2>
 *
 * `IssuerResolver` settles it once at startup, and the discovery document's
 * `issuer`, the endpoint URLs it advertises and the `iss` claim of every token
 * are all that same string. Before that it was derived per request, so a token
 * minted at loopback and a document fetched from a virtual machine disagreed.
