 * A minted token and, beside it, exactly what went into it.

 * The decoded claims are returned rather than left for the caller to base64.

 * refused something, and a response carrying only the compact serialisation
 * makes every diagnosis start with a decoding step.
 *
 * As with {@link MintRequest}, the component names are the wire names.
 *
 * @param token the compact serialisation
 * @param alg how it was signed; "NONE" when it was not
 * @param kid which key signed it, null for NONE
 * @param expiresIn the lifetime in seconds that was asked for; 0 or less means
 *        no `exp` claim was written
 * @param claims the payload, decoded
